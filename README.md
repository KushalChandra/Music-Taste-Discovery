# Music Taste Discovery

I have always known that I like music that I can feel in my chest. However, there are always songs that connect with me much more that other songs.
I don't know if it is because of the Artist or the language or some other characteristic of the song track.

I'm creating this repo to analyse my taste in music and hopefully find other similar songs.

My goals for this project are:
  1. Pull data from Spotify about all the songs I listen to
  2. Understand the different technical / quantifiable aspects of those songs
  3. Visualize my taste preference
  4. Try to find other songs on Spotify that match those preference and see if I like them or not


P.S. This is my first ever personal data project. Good Luck to me :)
